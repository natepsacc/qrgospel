 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. 

John 10:24 --> Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. 

John 10:25 --> Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. 

John 10:26 --> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. 

John 10:27 --> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 

John 10:28 --> And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. 

John 10:29 --> My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. 

John 10:30 --> I and my Father are one. 

John 10:31 --> Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. 

John 10:32 --> Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 

John 10:33 --> The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. 

John 10:34 --> Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? 

John 10:35 --> If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; 

John 10:36 --> Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? 

John 10:37 --> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 

John 10:38 --> But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. 

John 10:39 --> Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, 

John 10:40 --> And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. 

John 10:41 --> And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. 

John 10:42 --> And many believed on him there. 

John 11:1 --> Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. 

John 11:2 --> (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) 

John 11:3 --> Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. 

John 11:4 --> When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. 

John 11:5 --> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 

John 11:6 --> When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. 

John 11:7 --> Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. 

John 11:8
