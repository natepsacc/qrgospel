--> His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? 

John 11:9 --> Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. 

John 11:10 --> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. 

John 11:11 --> These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. 

John 11:12 --> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. 

John 11:13 --> Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. 

John 11:14 --> Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 

John 11:15 --> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. 

John 11:16 --> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. 

John 11:17 --> Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. 

John 11:18 --> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: 

John 11:19 --> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. 

John 11:20 --> Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. 

John 11:21 --> Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 

John 11:22 --> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. 

John 11:23 --> Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. 

John 11:24 --> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 

John 11:25 --> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 

John 11:26 --> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? 

John 11:27 --> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. 

John 11:28 --> And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. 

John 11:29 --> As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. 

John 11:30 --> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 

John 11:31 --> The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. 

John 11:32 --> Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not die
